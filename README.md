# Alpine Guide

This repository is meant as a guide for using the alpine server at the University of Colorado Anschutz. This is meant to be a comprehensive resource on how to use the server, any contributions are welcome!

## Getting help
If you don't find the answer to your question in this repository, Alpine has incredible documentation. We will refer to this documentation throughout this repository. You can access the alpine documentation [here](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## About Alpine
Alpine is a **Free** server to all members of the Anschutz campus. Running jobs is entirely free and you can use scratch storage for the majority of your work. Each user has 10TB of storage in scratch, but all files on scratch will be automatically deleted 90 days after the date they were copied or created. If you want any permanent storage, that can be purchased on the [peta library](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/resources/petalibrary/storageandrates).

Alpine uses a slurm scheduler to submit jobs and manage user resources. In this repository, we will provide details about how to interact with a slurm scheduler.

## Creating an account
All members of Anschutz must create an account following the tutorial [here](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access/rmacc.html). This includes for creating an [ACCESS-CI](https://access-ci.org/) account.
